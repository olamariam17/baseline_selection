# baseline_selection

### The goal of the project is selecting a baseline model based on multiple data versions using shell scripting
#### The script will automate and identify the best baseline model by
1) iterating baseline_model_results.csv in the report directory.
2) exerating baseline_model_results.csv in the report directory.
3) Generating a Markdown file baseline_model_report.md that summarizes:
•	Data version
•	Model name
•	Key performance metrics (F1-score, accuracy, etc.)
•	Confusion matrix image file (can be found through version number and model name)
